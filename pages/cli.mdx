# Command line interface
The pql library comes with a CLI for easy use of the library when shelling out
or for testing / development usage.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/runreveal/pql
```

## Usage
The command line interface is basic, and only has a `-h` and `-o` option.
```
$ pql --help
Translate Pipeline Query Language into SQL

Usage:
  pql [options] [FILE [...]]

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for pql
  -o, --output string   file to write SQL to (defaults to stdout)
```

The cli supports reading from stdin or a file, and writing to stdout or a file. By default, stdin
and stdout are used, but you can specify an input file by passing a filename as an argument to
the `pql` command, and you can specify an output file by using the `-o` flag.
```
$ echo "users | project user_id, user_email" | pql -o example.sql
$ cat example.sql 
SELECT "user_id" AS "user_id", "user_email" AS "user_email" FROM "users";
```

## Multiple Queries
Multiple pql queries can be passed to the pql cli at once. These queries _must_ be separated by a semicolon (`;`)

```
$ echo "users | project user_id, user_email; workspaces | project workspace_id, workspace_name" | ./pql               
SELECT "user_id" AS "user_id", "user_email" AS "user_email" FROM "users";

SELECT "workspace_id" AS "workspace_id", "workspace_name" AS "workspace_name" FROM "workspaces";
```
The result is multiple SQL queries that are also delimited with a semicolon.
