# Using pql with postgres 
Functions that are unknown (i.e. unlisted in the scalar functions docs) are passed through to the resulting SQL query.

Here's a basic example, finding email addresses that match gmail
using Clickhouse's `match` function [described here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions#match)
```
users
    | project user_email
    | where match(user_email, '@gmail.com')
```

Which translates successfully to this SQL statement:
```
WITH "__subquery0" AS (SELECT "user_email" AS "user_email" FROM "users")
SELECT * FROM "__subquery0" WHERE match("user_email", '@gmail.com')
```

# Functions
