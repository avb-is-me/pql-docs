# Using pql with postgres 
Functions that are unknown (i.e. unlisted in the scalar functions docs) are passed through to the resulting SQL query.

Here's a basic example, finding email addresses that match gmail
using postgres's `like` function [described here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions.html)
```
users
    | project user_email
    | where like(user_email, '%@gmail.com')
```

Which translates successfully to this SQL statement:
```
WITH "__subquery0" AS (SELECT "user_email" AS "user_email" FROM "users")
SELECT * FROM "__subquery0" WHERE like("user_email", '%@gmail.com')
```
