# now()

Returns the current UTC time, optionally offset by a given [timespan](scalar-data-types/timespan.md).

The current UTC time will stay the same across all uses of `now()` in a single query statement, even if there's technically a small time difference between when each `now()` runs.

## Syntax

`now(`[ *offset* ]`)`

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *offset* | timespan | | A timespan to add to the current UTC clock time. The default value is 0.|

## Returns

The current UTC clock time, plus the *offset* time if provided, as a `datetime`.

## Examples

### Find time elapsed from a given event

The method you create a time-interval will vary depending on your underlying database. Some databases use the INTERVAL keyword, which isn't supported in pql.

When using clickhouse, you can use `minus()`, and `toIntervalDay()` to create a time interval.

```kusto
StormEvents
| extend Elapsed=minus(now() - StartTime)
| take 10
```
