# summarize operator

Produces a table that aggregates the content of the input table.

## Syntax

*T* `| summarize` [ *SummarizeParameters* ]
      [[*Column* `=`] *Aggregation* [`,` ...]]
    [`by`
      [*Column* `=`] *GroupExpression* [`,` ...]]

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*Column*|string||The name for the result column. Defaults to a name derived from the expression.|
|*Aggregation*|string|&check;|A call to an [aggregation function](aggregation-functions.md) such as `count()` or `avg()`, with column names as arguments.|
|*GroupExpression*|scalar|&check;|A scalar expression that can reference the input data. The output will have as many records as there are distinct values of all the group expressions.|

> [!NOTE]
> When the input table is empty, the output depends on whether *GroupExpression*
> is used:
>
> * If *GroupExpression* is not provided, the output will be a single (empty) row.
> * If *GroupExpression* is provided, the output will have no rows.


## Returns

The input rows are arranged into groups having the same values of the `by` expressions. Then the specified aggregation functions are computed over each group, producing a row for each group. The result contains the `by` columns and also at least one column for each computed aggregate. (Some aggregation functions return multiple columns.)

The result has as many rows as there are distinct combinations of `by` values
(which may be zero). If there are no group keys provided, the result has a single
record.

To summarize over ranges of numeric values, use `bin()` to reduce ranges to discrete values.

## Aggregates default values

The following table summarizes the default values of aggregations:

| Operator | Default value |
|--|--|
| `count()`, `countif()`| 0 |

 When using these aggregates over entities that includes null values, the null values will be ignored and won't participate in the calculation (see examples below).

## Examples

### Unique combination

The following query determines what unique combinations of `State` and `EventType` there are for storms that resulted in direct injury. There are no aggregation functions, just group-by keys. The output will just show the columns for those results.

```pql
StormEvents
| where InjuriesDirect > 0
| summarize by State, EventType
```

**Output**

The following table shows only the first 5 rows. To see the full output, run the query.

| State | EventType |
|---|---|
| TEXAS | Thunderstorm Wind |
| TEXAS | Flash Flood |
| TEXAS | Winter Weather |
| TEXAS | High Wind |
| TEXAS | Flood |
|...|...|

### Minimum and maximum timestamp

Finds the minimum and maximum heavy rain storms in Hawaii. There's no group-by clause, so there's just one row in the output.


```pql
StormEvents
| where State == "HAWAII" and EventType == "Heavy Rain"
| project Duration = EndTime - StartTime
| summarize Min = min(Duration), Max = max(Duration)
```

**Output**

| Min | Max |
|---|---|
| 01:08:00 | 11:55:00 |

### Distinct count

Create a row for each continent, showing a count of the cities in which activities occur. Because there are few values for "continent", no grouping function is needed in the 'by' clause:

```kusto
StormEvents
| summarize TypesOfStorms=dcount(EventType) by State
| sort by TypesOfStorms
```

**Output**

The following table shows only the first 5 rows. To see the full output, run the query.

| State | TypesOfStorms |
|---|---|
| TEXAS | 27 |
| CALIFORNIA | 26 |
| PENNSYLVANIA | 25 |
| GEORGIA | 24 |
| ILLINOIS | 23 |
|...|...|

### Histogram

The following example calculates a histogram storm event types that had storms lasting longer than 1 day. Because `Duration` has many values, use `bin()` to group its values into 1-day intervals.

```kusto
StormEvents
| project EventType, Duration = EndTime - StartTime
| where Duration > 1d
| summarize EventCount=count() by EventType, Length=bin(Duration, 1d)
| sort by Length
```

**Output**

| EventType | Length | EventCount |
|---|---|---|
| Drought | 30.00:00:00 | 1646 |
| Wildfire | 30.00:00:00 | 11 |
| Heat | 30.00:00:00 | 14 |
| Flood | 30.00:00:00 | 20 |
| Heavy Rain | 29.00:00:00 | 42 |
| ... | ... | ... |
